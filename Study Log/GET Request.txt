Cannot GET /
-> GET은 http의 Method// http는 서버끼리 의사소통하는 방식
-> GET은 무엇인가를 서버에 요청하는 것을 의미
-> get the page : request

GET - http method


const handleGet = () => console.log("fuck you!");

app.get("/", handleGet);//root로 Request를 보내면 callback을 시켜주겠다.
-> 실재 실행시 fuck you 실행됨

but console.log 는 좋은 대답이 아님 // 우리느 html을 원한다!

How to respond to a GET request, which is one kind of requests & How the HTTP requests work (When they start and how they die)
After we create express app, we can write code that relates to express.
- We create the application, configure it, and open it to the outside the world.

Requests & responses
- Request: the user is asking or you something (basically doing something to you)
-- Our case: the browser is requesting the homepage (root) with a GET
- app.get("/", () => console.log("Somebody is trying to go home."));
: teach my app that when somebody sends a GET request to some route, we're going to add and create a callback
-- You need to send a function
-- The browser is sending you a GET request
- How requests work: "The browser says I want to get this url.
Okay, my server can handle that. So then when your request comes in, your server now knows that we can handle that. And it moves onto the function."
- When the user says "give me," what the browser is actually doing is making a GET request
-- GET request: has a route
--- Route: where we're going or what we're trying to get
